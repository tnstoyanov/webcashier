# Force cache invalidation strategies for Render.com

echo "=== RENDER.COM CACHE INVALIDATION STRATEGIES ==="
echo ""

echo "1. Current repository state:"
echo "   - Local size: $(du -sh . | cut -f1)"
echo "   - Git history: $(du -sh .git | cut -f1)"
echo "   - Latest commit: $(git log --oneline -1)"

echo ""
echo "2. Why Render.com might show 2.7GB:"
echo "   - Docker build cache contains old layers"
echo "   - Platform-level caching of repository snapshots"
echo "   - Build context cache from previous deployments"

echo ""
echo "3. Solutions to try:"
echo "   a) Added cache busting ARG to Dockerfile âœ“"
echo "   b) Contact Render.com support to clear cache manually"
echo "   c) Change repository name/URL (nuclear option)"
echo "   d) Wait for cache TTL to expire naturally"

echo ""
echo "4. Key question:"
echo "   - Does the BUILD complete successfully?"
echo "   - If yes, the 2.7GB is just cache overhead"
echo "   - The actual deployment size should be minimal"
